## Interview 1: Jack – 20, 2nd Year, Electrical Engineering
Interviewer: Hey Jack, thanks for doing this interview. Just to kick things off, can you tell me a bit about yourself, like what you’re studying, what year you're in?  
Jack: Yeah, for sure. I'm 20, currently in my second year of Electrical Engineering.  

Interviewer: Nice. I’m guessing you’ve done your fair share of group projects by now?   
Jack: Oh yeah, pretty much every semester has at least one. There was ENGG1100 in the first year, that was a massive group design project. Then we’ve had group labs, coding projects, and even a robotics assignment recently.    

Interviewer: And how have those experiences been for you overall?    
Jack: Honestly, a mix. I’ve had teams where everything clicked, everyone contributed, we had fun, and we smashed it. But there’ve also been groups where I’ve ended up doing way more than my share. It really depends on the people you get.  

Interviewer: Yeah, fair enough. Do you remember any particular challenges that came up?  
Jack: For sure. One group didn’t really get how GitHub worked, so we kept clashing over versions and accidentally deleting stuff. Communication’s always a big one too. People say they’ll do something and then ghost for three days. You start second-guessing everything.  

Interviewer: That kind of radio silence would definitely be frustrating. Did it ever get to the point where you were just over it?  
Jack: Yep. There was one group where I basically became the unofficial project manager, not by choice. I was coordinating everyone, fixing bugs, and chasing people up. It drained me like I couldn’t focus on learning the content, I was too busy herding cats.  

Interviewer: I feel like that happens a lot more than people admit. When things are working well, though, what makes it work?  
Jack: Communication and accountability. Even if you're behind, just say so, it’s fine, we can adjust. But if you say “all good” and then don’t do your part, that wrecks it for everyone. Also, using proper tools helps, shared calendars, task lists, that sort of thing.  

Interviewer: What kind of tools do you usually use in teams?  
Jack: Mostly Discord for chat and calls. Google Docs for reports, obviously. Trello if someone sets it up. GitHub for code, though it depends if people actually know how to use it properly. Sometimes people pretend to and then you get... disasters.  

Interviewer: Been there. Do you reckon those tools are enough for effective collaboration?  
Jack: I mean... they can be. But they rely on people using them right. Like Trello’s useless if no one checks it. Discord works if people actually respond. It’s less about the tool and more about the team culture, I think.  

Interviewer: Totally. And how are roles usually decided in your teams? Like, do you divvy things up or just wing it?  
Jack: Usually, we divvy things up informally. Like “you’re better at reports, you take that, I’ll do hardware.” But sometimes no one really wants to lead, and that’s when things stall. In the better teams, someone naturally steps up to coordinate, even if it’s unofficial.  

Interviewer: That’s fair enough, thank you, Jack!

## Interview 2: Aisha – 23, Final Year, Master of Architecture
Interviewer: Thanks for making time, Aisha! Could you start by telling me a bit about yourself, what you’re studying and where you’re at in the program?  
Aisha: Sure! I'm in my final year of the Master of Architecture at UQ. I also did my undergrad here, so I've been part of the EAIT faculty for... five years now?

Interviewer: So plenty of group work under your belt then?  
Aisha: Oh yeah. Studio projects are almost always collaborative. We usually work in pairs or teams of three to five. I think I’ve done over a dozen group assignments at this point.  

Interviewer: That’s wild. Have those mostly been smooth, or?  
Aisha: Mostly okay, though there’s always a bit of tension at some point. Architecture is such a subjective field and people get very emotionally attached to their designs. So when your ideas clash, it can feel personal even when it’s not meant to be.  

Interviewer: Yeah, I imagine that creative conflict can be tricky. Has that ever derailed a project for you?  
Aisha: Not entirely, but it’s definitely slowed things down. One time, we spent two whole meetings debating over facade aesthetics when we had a submission due in a few days. In the end, someone just had to back down. But it kind of left a bitter taste.  

Interviewer: Yeah, I can see how that would mess with the team dynamic. What else tends to make or break your group work?  
Aisha: Honestly? Presence. Like just turning up, physically or virtually. The best groups I’ve been in had people who actually showed up to meetings and put in the hours. The worst ones had at least one ghost.  

Interviewer: Happens more often than it should. When it comes to collaboration, do you feel like your voice gets heard?  
Aisha: In most teams, yes. But I’ve also been the only woman in the group, or the only one not from a particular cultural background, and sometimes that changes things. Not always in a bad way, but you notice when your ideas get sidelined. It affects how much you’re willing to speak up later on.  

Interviewer: That’s a really good point. So when teams do work well, what’s the secret sauce?  
Aisha: Open-mindedness. Mutual respect. And honestly, good structure. When we had someone take a “coordination” role, like tracking deadlines or checking in on tasks, it made everything flow better. It doesn’t even have to be formal, just someone who takes initiative.  

Interviewer: What about tools? What do you typically use in your teams?  
Aisha: We use Miro for brainstorming, which is amazing. Google Drive for sharing docs and drafts. Canva or InDesign for visual stuff. Group chats on Messenger or WhatsApp. We used Slack once, but people didn’t really engage with it.  

Interviewer: Do you think those tools support effective collaboration?  
Aisha: Partially. Miro’s great for early design stages. But chats get chaotic fast, like 100 unread messages and you miss the one important detail. I wish we had better systems for tracking decisions or action items across platforms.  

Interviewer: And how are roles usually structured?  
Aisha: It’s mostly skill-based. If someone’s great at modelling, they get the Rhino files. If someone writes well, they take on the report. But I wish there was more explicit structure early on. It would save a lot of “wait, who was doing that again?” moments.

## Interview 3: Kevin – 21, 1st Year, Computer Science
Interviewer: Alright Kevin, thanks for chatting! Can you just start by telling me what you’re studying and where you’re up to?  
Kevin: Yep! I’m 21, in my first year of Computer Science at UQ. Just finished my second semester.  

Interviewer: Awesome. So you’ve had a bit of exposure to group work by now?  
Kevin: Yeah, I had a couple of group projects, one where we built a website, and another where we made a mini game. Both were with teams of three or four.  

Interviewer: And how’d that go?  
Kevin: Pretty mixed. The web project was rough, we didn’t communicate properly and left things too late. But the game project was way better. We set up weekly calls and planned everything on a shared doc. Huge difference.  

Interviewer: What made the second one go smoother, do you think?  
Kevin: Honestly? Having one person take the lead helped. She kept us on track, reminded us of tasks, and was super organised. We didn’t really vote on it, she just kind of became the organiser and it worked.  

Interviewer: That kind of leadership sounds underrated. Were there any challenges you ran into along the way?  
Kevin: Yeah, version control was a big one. We used GitHub, but some of us were new to it. One teammate pushed an old version and it broke half the code. Also, people had different work styles, some would start early, others would cram. That caused tension.  

Interviewer: Ever find yourself feeling frustrated?  
Kevin: Yeah. Especially when someone said “I’ll get it done tonight” and didn’t, and didn’t tell anyone either. That silence is worse than being late, because you don’t know whether to jump in or wait.  

Interviewer: For sure. And on the flip side, what makes a team feel good to be in?  
Kevin: I really value honesty. Like if you’re stuck, just say so. It’s fine. Also clear roles, when it’s ambiguous, we either duplicate work or leave gaps. A shared task list helped heaps in my second group.  

Interviewer: What tools did you all use?  
Kevin: Discord for calls and chat, GitHub for code, Trello for tracking tasks. Google Docs for reports. And VS Code Live Share was handy, you can literally code at the same time and see each other’s cursors.  

Interviewer: Did you find those tools helped with collaboration?  
Kevin: When used properly, yes. But like... Trello only worked because one of us kept it updated. Otherwise, it’s just a pretty board. Discord was great for calls, though sometimes we got distracted talking about gaming instead of working.  

Interviewer: Haha, very relatable. Final question, how were roles usually assigned?  
Kevin: Usually, we split by strengths. Like “you take front-end, I’ll do logic.” But no formal titles. It worked okay as long as people spoke up early about what they couldn’t do, which saved time later.  

Interviewer: Thanks for the interview, Kevin, all the best!  


## SEAN  
## Interview 1: Bachelor of Science Double Specialisation in Environmental, Earth, and Marine Systems, Half-Way.
Hello Monique.  
Hello Sean.   

So I have a couple questions for you today. Could you say what your age, year, level, like year and discipline is? Like what you study? At uni?  
Yeah. I'm 22 and I'm studying a double specialisation in environmental, earth and marine systems at Southern Cross Uni and I'm halfway through my degree.  
Perfect, thank you very much. Have you done group work assignments before?   
Plenty.   

How did you find them?   
They're okay most of the time, but I feel like sometimes it's difficult to work with people who you don't know very well.  

How would you describe the good and the bad path? The good path meaning how did you find it good and what made it feel good? And the opposite obviously for the bad one.  
I think it's good when everyone collaborates and kind of knows what their strengths are. I think it works well when you know I'm really good at this so I'm gonna designate myself to that role for this assignment, but I think sometimes it can really clash, especially if you feel like someone's not really pulling their weight in the group, then it can be difficult to Bring attention to that especially if it's a collated mark at the end of the assignment.  

Thank you very much. So would you say you've already kind of answered that question? Have you encountered any challenges? You would say those are the main challenges you face?  
Yeah, and also communication. Maybe it's a bit different for me because I study online, but if you are struggling to reach someone you can't really chase them down.  

Yeah, like the confrontational part is missing.  
Yeah, you have to be comfortable contacting your professor which we had to do. With one of our first assignments, we got automatically allocated into a group and one of the students just hadn't responded to anything. We were getting close to actually starting our assignment and we had delegated the tasks and we had to eventually just contact our professor and tell him to kick the guy out of the group because he wasn't responding.   

That's crazy. So, would you say you have felt frustrated in the context of working in a team?   
Not majorly, but I feel like, yeah. I prefer working alone. Because I think that if you don't feel heard, you can get really frustrated. I feel like it can get frustrating whether it's your own fault or not, whether you're not actively putting in the effort to get your ideas across or your teammates are just not really considering you. I feel like it can be frustrating regardless.   

What would you say, what do you find most helpful slash what do you value most when working in a team?   
Communication.  
Like clear communication?   

Yeah, yeah.   
Planning ahead? Yeah definitely planning ahead and knowing the roles everyone has taken on and what your responsibilities are because then you can actually hold someone accountable or yourself accountable if something hasn't been done. If you have clear-cut instructions and tasks, then I feel like it takes out a lot of the struggle that you can face.  

What sort of tools do you use in your teamwork?  
Every time I've had a group assessment, you communicate via Blackboard and then you figure out in a chat, you figure out the best. For our last one, I think... I'm not sure. I can't really remember. Maybe it's a bit different for you guys. Because it's more techie, but with us it's more just like, okay, this person's doing this, this person's doing that. It depends how big the team is. Yeah, good point. If it's small, it's fine.  

Yeah, yeah. And last question. How has your team's been structured, such as roles, responsibilities, hierarchy?   
What do you mean?   

Is it pretty clear cut who does what?  
I feel like you would expect, I would expect someone to put their foot forward first and just be like, okay, I'm taking charge. I haven't really experienced that. I feel like everyone's kind of been like, okay, so… what does everyone like to do? Because it is better to just play to your strengths. But I feel like there's always kind of... Let's organize this, let's do that, let's whatever.

## Interview 2: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Economics, first semester.  
Hey Joshua. Hey Sean.  
Nice to see you. Thank you for your time.  

Yeah, no worries. So, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions and just answer with your best knowledge.  
Yeah, sure. Thank you, Sean.  

So, first question is, would you just mind saying your age, your year, and your degree?  
Yeah, sure. My name is Josh. I'm 23 years old and I just started my degree in computer science and economics.  

Thank you, Josh. Have you done group work assignments before?  
Yes, I have. Many. At work and at uni.  

Ah, nice. So how did you find them?  
I actually have mostly good experience. A big part where a negative experience would come from is just an disorganized team and having to deal with communication and planning issues.  

Okay, so you described that would be the bad path. How would a good project look like?  
Yeah, I mean, just pretty much the opposite. It's just the inverse of that. If those topics are clear, if everyone has... some kind of ownership and is communicating in a professional and timely manner. I think that's the good path for a successful project.  

Oh, nice. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Would you say you've encountered any challenges?   
Yes. Obviously, most challenges stem from exactly those issues I just described. For example, once we had someone not communicate at all and the professor also didn't know if that student may have just unenrolled or left that class. So we were in limbo kind of for a couple days or even a week or two, which obviously cost us some time. But we were still able to get the curve.  

Yes, so have you ever felt frustrated in the context of working in a team?   
I wouldn't actually say frustrated. So far, my teamwork experiences have all been pretty good, or at least the ones I can remember. So I would say, actually, not frustrated. Obviously, that some things are a bit more challenging or just unnecessary issues you face. When someone's not communicating or something similar, but not like a true deep frustration, no.   

Ah, nice to hear. What would you find most helpful? What do you, or what do you say would you value when working in a team?   
Yeah, I mean, I kind of already explained what I probably value most is just. People having their ownership in the project, in the things they're responsible for, and obviously a professional and timely.   

What sort of technologies and tools do you use in your teamwork?   
Yeah, so usually we just use the classic M365 suite as I'm working in a traditional financial company. It's not focusing on cutting-edge communication technologies. So those are mainly the tools we use.   

Okay, yeah, so would you say those tools can help you have effective discussions as a team? With the tools you mentioned.   
Yeah, I think they are doing the basics right, which is just Asynchronous communication, but I would say that that there are definitely tools that would maybe do a better job in making you feel more connected. But yeah, I obviously also wouldn't know how that would look like exactly.   

Oh yeah, thank you. Yeah, that's interesting. How have your teams been structured in the last couple of projects? For example, the roles, responsibilities and the hierarchy in general.   
Um, yeah, usually it was always pretty clear who will do which kind of role in the project because. People were, uh, were actually quite open. We're actually quite open with their skills. So they said what their strengths and weaknesses are, or even what they want to learn and profit in that project. Because I think it's an important part. Only because you're good at certain things or if you have experience in certain topics already doesn't mean you are. I think it's important to also get out of your comfort zone and learn different skills. For example, I've more often than not fell into the role of the project manager just because I like doing it and I like communicating with my team. So yeah, I would say that's about it.   

Nice. Thank you, Josh for your answers to those questions.  


## MING  
## Interview 1
Interviewer: Okay. Hello, just to clarify that you give consent for this being recorded.  
Speaker: Yep.  

Interviewer: All right, thank you. Um, all righty. Okay, we'll just start off with some preliminary questions. If you're able to tell us what you're studying and what year you are.  
Speaker: I'm studying chemical engineering and I'm in my fifth year.  

Interviewer: With that, have you done any group work?   
Speaker: Yes, yes.  

Interviewer: Every semester?  
Speaker: Every semester. At least one every semester.  

Interviewer: Okay, that is good. Give me one second.  
Interviewer: So you've said you've done it every semester, so you probably have a big sample size. How did you find them?  
Speaker: Mostly good.  

Interviewer: What made them good?  
Speaker: I think it's quite rare, that’s probably not the response you usually get—but mostly my groups have been fine. Mainly because they like to pair us off with at least one of our friends.  

Interviewer: Oh, so like you get a preference?  
Speaker: Earlier in the years it was all random, but I think I just lucked out. They put you with at least one person you usually sit with, so if you're friends with the right people it works out.  

Interviewer: So you'd say working with a friend helps a lot?  
Speaker: Yeah.  

Interviewer: What sort of work did you have to do in your courses? Was it roughly the same throughout all the years?  
Speaker: No, it varies. Just last semester, all we did was group work for all of my courses. They got group-heavy, but we got to choose our groups. We actually chose the same group across three courses, which was good because we were familiar with each other. We weren’t afraid to speak up if something was wrong or if someone was slacking off.  

Interviewer: Did you encounter any new challenges throughout the years?  
Speaker: Actually, I did this semester. In one of my metallurgy courses, it was difficult when someone didn’t show up to the prac that we had to do a report on. They were still there for the report but not the prac, so it wasn’t ideal.  

Interviewer: Did that make you feel frustrated?  
Speaker: Yeah, I guess, but it wasn’t a big assignment so it was fine. There were quite a lot of us. I would’ve been more frustrated if there were fewer of us and I had to pick up more work.  

Interviewer: Do you think equitable distribution of work is important, or does engineering push technical stuff to the more technical people?
Speaker: I think it’s never possible to do equitable work. You try at first, but if someone is better at task A, they’ll do A. If you’re better at task B, you’ll do B. That’s just how good teamwork works.  

Interviewer: And because you’ve worked with a lot of friends, I’m guessing you never really had much trouble being heard or voicing your opinions?
Speaker: No, not really.  

Interviewer: For those team projects, what technologies or tools did you use for collaboration?  
Speaker: OneDrive and Messenger. Nothing else. One time we used WhatsApp instead, because an international student didn’t use Facebook. But most of our collaboration was through actual meetings, so it didn’t really affect anything.  

Interviewer: Did you do meetings and voice calls as well?  
Speaker: Yeah. Sometimes it was hard to schedule, especially if someone worked part-time, so it worked better online. This semester, for example, we had a girl living on the Gold Coast, so we just did Zoom or Teams instead of making her travel.  

Interviewer: So you feel technology helps if collaboration is distributed?  
Speaker: For sure. It’s good to know what everyone else is doing, and you need at least a weekly check-in to make sure everything gets done.  

Interviewer: How were your teams usually structured? Was there a hierarchy or roles?  
Speaker: It was more of a loose hierarchy. Like, the same person always schedules meetings just because they’ve always done it, or the same person takes minutes. But not like an official leader.  

Interviewer: But regardless, you feel there was a clear way you communicated and collaborated?  
Speaker: Yep.  

Interviewer: Final question: if you had any conflict in the past couple of years, what was it about?  
Speaker: Not really conflict, but in one course—Advanced Risk—we chose our groups, and there was one person who hadn’t done the prerequisite course. I think they had studied overseas. It was clear they lacked the required knowledge, which was frustrating. We gave them tasks that weren’t technical, more like writing and research. That was more of an issue with the university letting them enrol without the prerequisites.  

Interviewer: How did you work around that?  
Speaker: We just gave them non-technical tasks, which they did well. The course coordinator even approached us because they realized the person didn’t know the content. They told us to keep workloads equal, so we adjusted for that.  

Interviewer: Okay. Just curious—those friends you mentioned earlier, were you friends with them already or did you make them along the way?  
Speaker: Half and half. I knew three from high school, and the others I met through coursework, like at the big round collaboration tables.  

Interviewer: And you guys did stuff outside of coursework too, like a real relationship was formed?  
Speaker: Yeah, sometimes. But also just studying and assignments.  

Interviewer: Great, I think I have everything I need. Thank you so much for the interview. This will remain confidential between only researchers and yourself. Is that okay?  
Speaker: Yeah, all good.  

Interviewer: Thank you so much. I’ll end the recording now.  

--- 

## Interview 2
Interviewer: Okay, just to confirm again, you’re fine with this being recorded?  
Speaker: Yeah, that’s all good.  

Interviewer: Great, thank you. Let’s start with some basics. What are you studying and what year are you in?  
Speaker: I’m doing a double degree in Commerce and IT. I’m in my third year.  

Interviewer: All right. Have you had much experience with group work in your courses so far?  
Speaker: Oh, yeah. Pretty much every semester. Some units are heavier on it than others, but I’d say at least two group projects each semester.  

Interviewer: And overall, how have you found those experiences?  
Speaker: Mixed, honestly. Some groups have been great, like everyone was on the ball. But I’ve had a fair few where it was pretty rough—people not showing up, not pulling their weight, that kind of thing.  

Interviewer: What made the good ones good, in your view?  
Speaker: When everyone actually cared. Like if it was a capstone subject or something that counted for a lot, people would take it seriously. Also, when the group was smaller, like three people, it was way easier to manage. Big groups just get messy.  

Interviewer: And what about the bad ones?  
Speaker: Mostly freeloaders. You always end up with someone who just vanishes until the last week. Or they’ll show up to meetings but haven’t done anything. One time I had to literally write someone’s section from scratch the night before because it was just unusable.  

Interviewer: Did that frustrate you?  
Speaker: Yeah, heaps. Especially when grades are shared, like you all get the same mark. It feels unfair when you’re covering for someone else.  

Interviewer: What about scheduling? Did you face any challenges there?  
Speaker: Oh definitely. Like, everyone’s timetables are different, some people are working part-time, some full-time even. Trying to get five people in one place at the same time is impossible. We mostly ended up doing online calls, but even then people would join late or just not at all.  

Interviewer: So you used online tools—what kind?  
Speaker: Mostly Teams and Google Docs. Teams for meetings, Docs for writing together. Sometimes Slack if it was an IT unit. But even then, not everyone knows how to use them properly, like people wouldn’t update the doc or they’d send random drafts in Messenger instead of putting it in the shared folder. Stuff gets lost so easily.  

Interviewer: Do you feel that technology solved more problems than it created?  
Speaker: It definitely helps, but if people don’t use it right it just adds confusion. Like one group insisted on emailing everything, which was just a nightmare compared to using one shared drive.  

Interviewer: How did you usually split up the work in your groups?  
Speaker: Usually at the start we’d try to divide it evenly, like “you do the intro, I’ll do analysis,” that sort of thing. But it never stays equal. Someone always ends up being the “editor” who has to pull everything together and fix the formatting, and that person does way more work than anyone else. A lot of the time, that ended up being me.  

Interviewer: Did you ever have issues with clashing approaches, like different work styles?  
Speaker: Yeah. Commerce students and IT students definitely think differently. Like, in a systems design subject, the IT people want all the technical detail, while the commerce side is more about the business implications. Sometimes we’d clash over what was more important. You have to kind of compromise, but it slowed us down a lot.  

Interviewer: Were you usually comfortable voicing your opinions in groups?  
Speaker: Mostly, yeah. But if there’s someone really dominant, it’s harder. I had one group where one guy just kind of took over everything, and it was awkward to push back even when he wasn’t right.  

Interviewer: Did any of your groups have clear roles, like a leader?  
Speaker: Sometimes it happens naturally. Like one person just organises meetings and everyone goes with it. But we never officially set roles. I think having clearer roles would’ve saved us from confusion.  

Interviewer: If you think back, what was your most difficult group project and why?  
Speaker: Probably last semester in an IT project unit. We had six people, and two of them barely contributed. They’d show up to the final presentation but hadn’t touched the code or written a thing. The rest of us had to cover for them. We tried talking to the tutor, but they just told us to “work it out amongst ourselves,” which wasn’t helpful. It caused a lot of resentment.  

Interviewer: How did you manage that situation?  
Speaker: We basically just cut them out of the technical work and gave them smaller tasks, like formatting references. It wasn’t ideal, but at least the core stuff got done.  

Interviewer: Last question, did you make any friends through these group projects, or was it more just coursework?  
Speaker: A couple, yeah. I still talk to a few people from my first-year commerce units. But mostly it’s just been classmates I work with for a semester and then don’t really see again.  

Interviewer: Okay, great. I think that covers everything. Thanks so much for sharing, and just to reassure you, this transcript will remain confidential between the research team and yourself. Is that okay?  
Speaker: Yeah, no worries.  

Interviewer: Perfect. Thanks again, I’ll stop the recording here.  


## RITISHA
## Interview 1
Interviewer: Hi, thank you for being here today for this interview. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?  
Participant (Participant): Hi, I'm Participant. I’m a Master's student in Interaction Design at UQ. I started the program a little over a year ago, and so far it’s been a mix of exciting and challenging experiences. My background is in graphic design, so I usually bring creative and visual strengths to projects. I also enjoy research and exploring how design can improve teamwork and communication.  

Interviewer: Being part of the Master's cohort, have you often been part of group projects?  
Participant: Yes, definitely. Almost every subject I’ve taken has required some form of group project, so I’ve worked in teams every semester. These projects usually involve people from very different backgrounds—designers, developers, researchers—which makes collaboration both rewarding and sometimes tricky.   

Interviewer: And how has your experience been? Can you describe the most recent one?  
Participant: The most recent group I worked with was really positive. Everyone was committed and communicated well. We had a shared calendar for meetings, and people were proactive in updating each other if they couldn’t make it. It felt like we were on the same page, and that helped us stay on track. For example, in our last sprint, we divided the tasks very clearly, and people actually delivered what they promised, which made the final integration much smoother.   

Interviewer: That’s great. What about a time when you didn’t have a good experience?  
Participant: In contrast, my first semester was difficult. I was new, still figuring out how things worked at UQ, and we were asked to form groups with people we didn’t know. The idea was that different skills would balance each other, but two members of my team were always late, didn’t show up to meetings, or didn’t communicate. This caused delays—we missed deadlines, had to redo work, and it created frustration for the rest of us. In the end, we somehow managed to pull it together, but the stress was much higher compared to groups where everyone was engaged.   

Interviewer: During that hard experience, what methods did you use to resolve those hardships?  
Participant: At first, we tried to handle it internally—setting up meetings, directly addressing the issues, and clarifying expectations. For instance, we listed out who was responsible for what and tried to identify where the gaps were. When that didn’t improve things, we reached out to the tutor. The tutor helped mediate by setting clear expectations for everyone and reminding us of deadlines. Having that external accountability made a difference, even though not everything improved overnight.   

Interviewer: What was the most frustrating part of working in such a team?  
Participant: The biggest frustration was the communication gap. If someone couldn’t do their task, I’d rather they just told us in advance so we could redistribute the workload. But when people stayed silent and only admitted on the submission day that they hadn’t done their part, it left the rest of us scrambling. It wasn’t so much about the missing work—it was the lack of honesty and reliability that caused stress.   

Interviewer: Do you usually prefer in-person meetings or online meetings? And why?  
Participant: I generally prefer online meetings because of the convenience. I can attend from home, which saves travel time, and it makes scheduling easier since everyone just needs to log in. However, I also recognize that online meetings can sometimes lack energy or engagement. In-person meetings force everyone to be more focused, but they also require extra coordination. So for me, online is the practical choice, while in-person works better for key discussions.   
Interviewer: In group settings, do you feel heard and that your opinion is valued?  

Participant: It really depends on the team dynamic. In good teams, I feel heard because people build on my ideas, acknowledge what I’ve said, and include me in decisions. But I’ve also been in situations where I felt ignored—either because someone dominated the conversation or decisions were made without considering everyone’s input. When that happens, I feel disconnected and less motivated to contribute.   

Interviewer: In teamwork, how would you categorize your role?  
Participant: My main role is usually the designer of the group, handling creative and visual tasks—like creating mockups, presentations, or prototypes. Because of my background, I’m often the one responsible for making things look cohesive and professional. I also help compile documents and, when needed, contribute to research. I don’t usually take on heavy coding tasks, but I’m always willing to learn and try if the project requires it.   

Interviewer: When starting a project, do you prefer brainstorming sessions in person or online?  
Participant: Brainstorming works best in person because it’s more spontaneous and collaborative. For example, in one course we had a session where we had to come up with 100 ideas quickly. Being in the same room made it easier to bounce ideas off each other and keep the momentum going. Online, it’s harder to replicate that energy. I think online meetings are better once tasks are already defined and we’re just updating progress.   

Interviewer: What kinds of technology do you usually use in team projects?  
Participant: For official meetings, we use Microsoft Teams since everyone has an account through UQ. For quick check-ins, sometimes WhatsApp calls. For collaboration, Miro boards are great for brainstorming, while Google Docs and Slides are our go-to tools for compiling and editing. They allow real-time editing, which saves a lot of back-and-forth. I also sometimes use design tools like Figma if the project involves UI work.   

Interviewer: Have these technologies ever been a hindrance rather than a help?  
Participant: Not really. They’ve mostly been very helpful. MS Teams helps us stay organized with scheduled meetings and reminders. Google Docs keeps all the content centralized. Miro makes it easy to visualize ideas. I think the only challenge is when people are unfamiliar with a tool—it can slow things down initially. But once everyone knows how to use it, the tools become an advantage.  

Interviewer: In in-person brainstorming, do you prefer using devices or just discussing face-to-face?  
Participant: Usually both. We discuss ideas face-to-face, but we also keep devices handy for quick research or to start capturing ideas on a Miro board. Devices are useful for documenting and structuring the brainstorm, but the real creativity comes from the discussions in the room.   

Interviewer: Do you find it easier to understand and be heard in person?  
Participant: Yes, definitely. In-person, there are fewer barriers—no internet lag, no technical issues. You can clarify things immediately, ask for examples, or explain with gestures. It helps the discussion move faster and reach conclusions more efficiently.   

Interviewer: Besides communication, what’s the second most valuable quality in teamwork for you?  
Participant: For me, it’s accountability—taking charge and knowing your limits. It’s fine to say no to tasks you’re not confident about. For example, I’m not strong in coding, so I always clarify that upfront. That way, the team doesn’t over-rely on me for something I might not deliver well. I think being honest about strengths and weaknesses makes the whole team function better.  

Interviewer: Any other thoughts on teamwork you’d like to add?  
Participant: I’d just add that trust is really important. When you trust your team, it’s easier to collaborate, share ideas, and take risks creatively. Without trust, everything feels like extra work.   

Interviewer: Thank you for your time.  
Participant: Thank you.

## Interview 2   
Interviewer: Hi, can you please tell me a bit about yourself?  
Participant: Yes, I’m currently studying at the University of Queensland and I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Biotechnology. I’ve always been interested in science and research, and biotechnology felt like the right path because it combines innovation with practical applications that can benefit society.  

Interviewer: Could you tell me a bit more about yourself and your background?  
Participant: Sure. I’m 23 years old, and I’ve had a strong academic focus throughout my studies. I enjoy collaborative work, but I also like working independently on research tasks where I can dive into articles and data. At UQ, the course structure involves a lot of projects, which has given me plenty of experience working in teams with different kinds of people.  

Interviewer: Have you ever done group assignments in your course?  
Participant: Yes, quite a few. Almost every major course I’ve taken so far has involved a group assignment or project component. These projects vary in scope—from small reports to larger semester-long projects—so I’ve experienced both positive and challenging group dynamics.  

Interviewer: What was one of the best groups you’ve been part of, and why did you think it was the best?  
Participant: One of the best groups I worked with was on a project called Sharpish. In that group, we had excellent rapport from the beginning. Everyone communicated openly, and there was a sense of mutual respect. What stood out to me was that everyone felt comfortable contributing ideas, no one dominated the discussion, and we naturally divided tasks in a fair way. Because of this, our work felt seamless and efficient.  

Interviewer: Other than communication, what other aspects made it a good group?  
Participant: Apart from communication, accessibility and accountability were key. It was very easy to contact each other, and people responded quickly whenever something needed attention. Everyone stuck to deadlines and delivered their parts on time, which built trust in the group. Another big factor was flexibility—if someone was struggling with a task, someone else would step in to help. That balance of support created a very positive environment, where we weren’t stressed about one person carrying the load.  

Interviewer: Can you recall an experience when you didn’t have a good time in a group project?  
Participant: Yes, there was one group project where everything seemed to fall apart. Some team members didn’t do their share of the work, deadlines were constantly missed, and the quality of contributions was inconsistent. This created frustration because others had to pick up the slack. The lack of accountability meant we were always running behind schedule, and the whole experience was draining instead of collaborative.  

Interviewer: How could that group project have been improved?  
Participant: I think it could have been improved with more structure and accountability. Setting realistic timelines and goals at the very beginning would have made a big difference. Also, having a proper communication system—like scheduled check-ins—would have kept everyone on the same page. If expectations had been clearer and followed up with, the group might have performed better.  

Interviewer: In your course, do you have phases like brainstorming, planning, and implementation? How do you usually go about it?  
Participant: Yes, most group projects follow that structure. We usually start with a brainstorming and ideation phase. For this phase, I prefer meeting in person because it’s easier to bounce ideas off each other and build energy in the room. In-person brainstorming makes discussions more interactive, and you can sketch or write on whiteboards, which helps visualize ideas. After that, we enter the execution phase where we work on our assigned tasks. During this time, we might not meet as frequently, but we keep updating each other online through collaboration tools. Finally, we prepare for the presentation phase, which involves practicing together and ensuring everyone knows their part.  

Interviewer: Do you prefer meeting online or in person?  
Participant: Again, it depends on the stage of the project. For ideation, I strongly prefer in-person meetings because they encourage more creativity and active participation. When we move into execution, online tools are useful for staying connected without the need for constant in-person meetings. But when we’re preparing to present or finalizing things, meeting in person is essential—it makes coordination smoother and helps the group feel more cohesive.  

Interviewer: At the start of a project, what tasks do you usually take up?  
Participant: I usually take responsibility for the initial research and documentation. I like searching academic databases, summarizing findings, and writing structured notes. During meetings, I often volunteer to take minutes so we have a clear record of decisions. I also enjoy breaking down complex information into digestible pieces for the group.  

Interviewer: What sort of tools do you use for your projects?  
Participant: For research, I rely heavily on UQ Library’s database of academic articles. I also use platforms like Statista when we need statistical data or trends. Google is helpful for general fact-checking, and occasionally, I use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate ideas or refine drafts. These are mostly individual tools, but they make my contribution to the group stronger.  

Interviewer: And for collaboration?  
Participant: Microsoft Teams is our main collaboration tool. It allows us to share files, track progress, and schedule meetings. Sometimes we also use shared documents on Google Drive for editing in real time. These tools are particularly helpful when the group can’t meet physically but still needs to stay productive.

Interviewer: When working in a team, what makes you feel most supported?  
Participant: I feel most supported when everyone shows commitment. When people communicate regularly, complete their tasks on time, and are open to feedback, it creates a sense of trust. It also helps when teammates acknowledge each other’s efforts—it keeps morale high and makes the work feel more collaborative.  

Interviewer: Do you usually have a hierarchy of roles in group projects?  
Participant: Yes, usually one person takes on the role of leader or captain. They serve as the main point of contact with the professor or tutor and help coordinate the project. Other roles are more fluid, based on who contributes most to a particular area. Sometimes, the person who invests the most time or effort naturally has more influence over decisions, which I think is fair. Their deeper knowledge or research often means their input is valuable to the group.  

Interviewer: Do you think that hierarchy helps?  
Participant: Yes, in most cases. Having someone with more knowledge or who’s contributed more lead certain aspects makes sense. It ensures decisions are informed and grounded. As long as the group respects each other’s contributions, the hierarchy feels supportive rather than restrictive.  

Interviewer: When you’re sitting together as a group, do you usually use devices or just talk?  
Participant: We usually have laptops or tablets with us. They’re essential for taking notes, looking up references, and checking drafts in real time. We try not to use mobile phones because they’re distracting.  

Interviewer: What do you usually search for on your laptop during group discussions?  
Participant: Mostly, I refine the points being discussed. For example, if someone brings up an idea, I’ll quickly check academic sources or data to support it. I also search for examples, case studies, or definitions that help the group align on the topic.  

Interviewer: So you’d say during ideation you prefer in-person meetings, but for planning and implementation you use collaboration tools online. Is that right?
Participant: Exactly. Ideation in person sparks creativity and ensures everyone’s ideas are heard. Once we’ve finalized the plan, collaboration tools make execution easier. For final presentations, nothing beats being in person and rehearsing together.  

Interviewer: Is there anything else you’d like to add about your group project experiences?  
Participant: I’d just say that group projects are fundamentally about collaboration. When everyone takes ownership and respects the process, the outcome is rewarding. But when collaboration fails, the project becomes stressful and unproductive. The biggest lesson I’ve learned is that good communication and shared responsibility make all the difference.  


## FELICIA
## Interview 1: Master of Interaction Design, Final Semester Student  
Okay, hi. First, maybe, can I just ask you some questions? What are you studying and which year are you in and stuff like that?  
Yeah, I'm doing a Master of Interaction Design and I'm in my fourth semester. That is my final semester. I'll graduate in December.   

Cool. Yeah, so maybe, can I just check if you've done group work assignments before?   
Yeah, all the time.  
 
Yeah, so can you maybe tell me about some of the group assignments that you have done? What are some of the good points and what are some of the bad experiences that you've had? Like both.   
Yeah, I think I'm doing an Interaction Design Master's course. So, most of the time, I think two to three courses is team projects.  
 
Up until now, except for this semester where I'm only doing one course that has a team project, because I'm doing a Master's thesis. I think since Sem 1, I've been lucky enough to be in good teams, mostly because I might find at least one person who's a strong team member, who I think is strong. So even if the others don't really do a lot of work, I feel like I can do it myself with the other member.    
 
But I've been pretty lucky that way. I would say, so it's good if everybody in the team works. And again, I'll talk about the good first.    
 
For me, last semester, we did a course called Physcom, and I had the strongest team, I would say. It's also because most of us had different backgrounds. So there was a mix, a good blend of the different skills that we could bring to the table.    
 
And I think eventually, we turned out to be good friends too. So one thing is team collaboration. If there's a good balance, not just in skills, but I think personalities as well, then there's a good mix.  
 
So I would say we were a team of five, and two of us would be pretty much extroverted, or more on the talking side of it. So didn't really care about that. And the other three would really work, but they appreciated us talking for not for them, but for the team too.  
 
But at the same time, I would make sure that everybody in the team could speak to because it doesn't matter if it's an extrovert or introvert, everybody has ideas and probably give them a space that's safe so they can speak too. And I think that the variety, the variations that we had in the team was a good aspect. So I think that was a good team.  
 
Because differences in personality and differences in skills and a good blend made it a good team. A bad team, if I can remember, would be back in my first semester, I think. It's when a team member doesn't really let you speak and wouldn't listen.  
 
I would always want their ideas to be heard, so wouldn't really accommodate to what the other person is saying. That was one of my bad experiences, but thankfully never teamed up with them again. For me, that's all.  
 
For my previous experiences, but not in UQ, it also happens when the other team members don't really work and sometimes you have to take up the whole load. That gets really disappointing too, but thankfully that doesn't happen now. So I think working with teams over the years has led me to understand what a good team or a bad team is.    
 
And not necessarily that every five or six members in the team has to put in a lot of work. It won't be ideal, maybe they won't, but there's definitely some skill that they can contribute. So even if they don't really do what you think they can do, it's best to know what the team's strengths are, so we can all work together.    
 
But at the same time, that doesn't mean the person just works on what they're best at, but everybody's there to learn as well. So if we can create a system in the team that, okay, this is what I'm good at, this is what I can do, but at the same time, I would like to learn this. And if we can share our knowledge and skills, then the team grows as well.  
 
So I think that's good and bad.  

Oh, yeah. I think maybe I would like to talk about any challenges that you've encountered.  
Any challenges specifically that you've encountered when doing teamwork?  
Yeah, I think the one that I remember is from the bad experience that I was talking about. Is it a challenge? It was, but what I did about it never teamed up after that. But I think, yeah, even last semester, there was another team.  
 
Initially, I thought the team's not going to go well, because there was another, well, apparently, we're all from different backgrounds as well. And I think I was, because obviously, I team up with somebody that I know, so I'm in my comfort space as well. But back then, I didn't really have my teammate with me.  
 
So it was a new team, five of them with me. So I didn't know them, they didn't know me as well. So I think not knowing each other initially had a trust issue.  
 
So that trust issue really didn't lead to the team working well. But after our first presentation, we figured that this is what's wrong. And maybe coming from a design background, I pretty much knew where this is leading to.  
 
But at the same time, I felt, okay, they don't really understand, but that's fine. We will work through it. And then they, all of us build trust with each other, then they figure, okay, this is more off on the deco side.  
 
So it's more on the research side. And this is how we have to go about it. And I think then the team worked really well, even that was an amazing team to us there. 
 
So I think identifying the challenges and trying to work with it might help better.   

Also, you mentioned that your teamwork is like, like deco side or whatever. So as in, so what kind of team, like describe the type of tasks that you usually have to do in a team context?  
Yeah, mostly it starts with research.  
 
Okay, there's a problem space, we think about the domains of what we're trying to do. It all starts with the brief, what the course requires. It's a little different, the deco courses, every course is a little different, the brief is different.  
 
So I worked with two teams last semester. One was more into building something, the other one was more into research. So it depends on that.  
 
But we still start with research, we look at what's there existing, what the team interests are, what we would like to do. And then we research on that, find a gap, figure out a problem space, and we move forward with it. But now where we work on it depends on if we actually have to build it or not.  
 
That's when we need a good mix of students from the technical side, from the research side and the design side. If it's there, I think the team works well.   

Have you felt frustrated in the context of working in a team? Do you feel like being heard is important? I feel like you answered that.  I guess, what tools or technologies do you use in teamwork? And do you feel that you can have effective discussions using those tools and technologies mentioned? This is for communication or collaboration. In general, in teamwork, what type of tools or technologies do you use?  
Do I use?   

In your team, yeah.   
In my team.  
 
Honestly, it varies a bit different based on the teams or what we're supposed to do. Something new that I'm using now is Discord, where we manage, we have different channels, where we just chat on one channel. That's general, where we save our team meetings, weekly meeting logs, the documents, the papers.  
 
But also something that we're using now is GitHub Projects, something called GitHub Projects, where we assign different tasks to different team members. That's something that I'm using this semester for this course. But I'm also tutoring another course where we're using the same as well.  
 
So it's something new to me. I think it's pretty efficient. But before that, what we used to have was probably channels, WhatsApp channels, maybe where we say, this is where we're going to have the meeting.  
 
This is what we're supposed to do. So in studios, we decide what we're going to do for the week, and then we work on it and update the channels, I think, up until now. But this semester, I'm using new tools as well.  
 
Like I mentioned, GitHub Projects and I think Discord, where we mark what's done, what's been doing in progress and things like that.   

How about like, you know, when you're collaborating together with your team?   
I think one tool that we use, the most commonly used one is MiroBoard, where we have brainstormed ideas, each of us can type it down and then we cluster them into groups or teams. For collaboration mostly, that's what we use.  
 
Like, do you feel that that has helped you have effective discussions as a team? Like why or why not?   
Yeah, definitely. Because it's also got a, it provides something like a whiteboard where you can sketch out your ideas or multiple users can type whatever they feel at the same time. So it's a collaborative tool.  
 
Similarly, I would say Google Docs or Slides too when we work on presentations and documentation. But if it's for brainstorm or ideation, MiroBoard works best. It's because most of us, it's a team of four, five, six, we can all work on together at the same time.  
 
If you were to talk about any like negatives of the tools of technologies that you use, what would it, are there any negative aspects of the tools of technologies that you use?   
Maybe I'm so used to them at this point that I cannot think about what's not good. Okay, so you feel like it effectively helps? Yeah. Okay.  
 
Like I said, maybe because I'm used to it. If I was a new user, maybe I could find out points but I think I'm okay with what I'm using now. Okay.  
 
Do you feel, I think me, maybe like last question, what do you find like, can you think of anything that would be like most helpful for you when you're working in a team to like improve any of the problems you mentioned?   
Yeah, I think this is, it can be realistic in the future because we have AR and VR now. But I like how, I still prefer in-person meetings because I feel there's more presence. So if we can have a remote, something that's connected with VR or I don't know, a room setting where everybody is virtually present and we know we can detect our faces or expressions at the same time, something like a whiteboard where we can, so in studio what we do is we have a whiteboard and we all actually sketch things out physically present.  
 
You can see each other doing it. This is again, not sure if it's realistic, but an environment where even though we're not in the same place together, but we can be, so it feels like we are actually physically present at the same time. Discuss it better.  
 
I think in-person meetings are faster than online meetings to be true.   

You value like presence. Yeah.  
So maybe a virtual space where we can all be together even though we're not.   

So for in-person discussions, do you feel like anything hinders your discussion while you are like even in-person with your team usually?  
I think that's when the team members are not present or like I said before, maybe they don't let you speak.   

What do you mean by not present? Like in-person?   
Yeah, so you're there, but you're not there. Does that make sense?  

Yeah. What causes them to be kind of like not there?   
I think maybe lack of interest. They don't want to do it or maybe they're like, okay, just give me the work and I'll just do it.  
 
They don't want to contribute. I guess. So it's on the same side.  
I would say two ends of the same board. One person wants to contribute too much and wouldn't let the others talk. One person doesn't really want to contribute, but team is the team.  
 
So everybody should say something, not say, but contribute because more ideas, I think better. And that's why I said I prefer in-person than online because if it's an online meeting, this can happen. We might say, oh, it's just, they're not comfortable talking.  
 
So they're silent. But if it's in-person, I feel like they're pretty much forced to talk more, maybe contribute more. Does that make sense?   

Yeah.  
And I think it's a behavior aspect as well. You know, everybody's here. So you have to, but if it's online, oh, nobody's watching me.  
 
So I don't really have to contribute. Maybe that's where that comes from.   

Cool.  
Okay. Thanks.   

You're welcome.

## Interview 2: Master of Interaction Design, Final Semester  
Hi, thanks for agreeing to the interview. Can you just maybe tell me what are you studying in UQ currently?   
I'm studying Master of Interaction Design. This is my second year and it's my last semester.  
 
Just a basic check, this interview will be about group work. Have you done group projects before?   
Yeah, lots. Pretty much all my subjects have group works involved.  
 
Can you maybe tell me some of the good and the bad of your group work so far?   
The good would probably be, if you're doing an individual project, it's all on you. Your success and your failure, it all entirely depends on you. But when you're doing group work, sometimes your teammates might surprise you.  
 
You'll be really shocked at how efficiently they're doing something. And then you take that as an opportunity to learn from them. It's also like, how do you put it, whenever you tend to fall short, somebody else will come and pick up the slack.  

So I like that aspect of teamwork.   

How about the bads?   
Yeah, the bads would probably be like, I had one incident where a teammate just was not doing any work and then she tried to completely disappear towards the end of the semester as well. It kind of does feel like sometimes you're carrying the whole team, but that's an extreme worst situation.  
 
Can you tell me a bit about the context of your group works? What type of projects do you usually do and how does it go?   

It's mostly design-based. I'm doing a lot of DECO courses. So a lot of it involves research, ideation, prototyping, user testing, and then back to research, ideation, prototyping.  
 
So it's mostly very iterative design stuff.   

Can you tell me about specific challenges that you have faced in group work?   
Specific challenges? Mostly it's collaboration and coordinating efforts. Generally, when I'm in a team, what I notice is that I like to do my work alone.  
 
So I'll mostly just assign parts to people and then we all go to our individual bits and then come back and then we discuss about how it all comes together. But the issue with this type of working is that two different people, even though they have different works assigned to them, they'll still end up covering the same type of topics and tasks, I guess. So there's double effort on something that only needed to be done once, I guess.  
 
So it's like collaboration in general has always been a little bit of a tricky thing because we're all super busy, we don't all find time to sit down and work together at the same time. So mostly it ends up happening over Discord or something. And then on Discord, it's a bit awkward being on call and it's just not the same as being present in real life, if that makes sense.  
 
Okay, so can you tell me about the points of frustration in the context of working in your team?   
Mostly just when someone is not really specifically within the context of Discord calls or in general?   

Working in a team or like anything, I guess. What makes you feel frustrated when you're working in a team?   
When someone just doesn't do their part and then they're just generally not very responsive. So it's like now not only do you have to do your own work, you also have to cover for them also.  
 
And then there's also a lot of things like, okay, am I imposing too much on this person? Is their behaviour report-worthy? Should I bring it to the attention of the tutors? There's a lot of opportunities for conflict and it's generally managing that stuff, I guess.   

Do you feel like being heard is important?   
Yes, it is.   

Can you elaborate on experiences you have with being heard or not being heard? How has that gone in group discussions?   

This actually ties back into the frustrations with working as a team as well.  
 
Personally, I'm somebody who likes to talk a lot, so I've never had issues with not being heard. But other people might feel like they're not being heard with me around, I feel like. But I think I've been working on it and I'm starting to get a little bit better at making sure that everybody in the table has a say.  
 
Which brings me to my frustration point. Sometimes I work with teammates who are not very vocal. They'll just be sitting quietly in the corner and they'll be like, yeah, I'll just agree with whatever the team says.  
 
That frustrates me because usually a person who does this is most likely not listening or paying attention to what the group is doing. So I have no way to gauge whether they're paying attention or not, if that makes sense. So I find that aspect of it slightly frustrating.  
 
Does that happen in real life or online?   
In real life as well.  

Does it happen more in real life and online?   
I think the people who tend to do this in real life will most likely replicate that behaviour online as well. So yeah, it's really hard to gauge their seriousness, if that makes sense.  
 
What do you find most helpful or what do you value when working in a team?   
I guess diverse skill sets. Generally in DECO courses, they usually dedicate one entire class to talking about diversity and how important it is. Initially I used to feel very frustrated about that.  
 
But then now that I'm in my final year, I'm starting to really value multiple perspectives and diversity within the team. Generally, it just makes it feel more rich, I guess.   

In what aspect? Maybe give an example.  
In terms of skill? For example, I'm somebody who's very strong in design. But then I have teammates who are very good. I'm talking specifically about my build group, for example.  
 
I have some teammates who are very good at machine learning. And one guy is very good at backend and SQL and stuff like that. And then we have two people who are very good at user experience design.  
 
But then one girl is specifically very good at documentation. Now, I am terrible at documentation. If there is a deadline, I'll mostly forget.  
 
But thankfully, I have never missed a deadline so far in my uni life. But this girl is so on top of it. Nobody needs to tell her anything.  
 
She will do everything herself and be like, Guys, I did this, this. Just check if anything else needs to be added. That is very cool of her.  
 
I respect that a lot. That's one thing.   

When you're doing your group work, what sorts of tools and technologies have you used?   
The thing that works best for us is probably Discord.  
 
Because it lets you create channels and then do votes as well. And then you can have meetings and stuff like that. Teams, for some reason, just doesn't have the same, I guess.  
 
I'm not really sure why. Teams just feels a bit more awkward compared to Discord, I think. Plus, Discord is something we use for gaming also.  
 
So, a lot of my friends, after we finish teamwork, sometimes we'll go play a game of Minecraft together or something like that. So, it's very convertible like that.   

So, you play games with your team as well?   
Sometimes. Not all my teammates, just one or two.   

So, you use Discord mostly for communication and stuff. How about collaborating? Do you use other tools?   
We have recently started using this tool called ClickUp, which is very similar to... I forgot it.  
 
Basically, you just create a list of tasks, break it down and then assign parts to it. And then you set a due date and then you have people. So, it's very easy to keep track of who's doing what using ClickUp.  
 
So, that's something we've started using from this semester. But in general, we also use Google Drive for file sharing. And then OneDrive in some cases, but not always.  
 
But yeah, these are the tools primarily we tend to use.   

Do you guys use any tools for brainstorming?   
Not really. It's just conversations in person.  
 
In terms of specific methodologies that we use for brainstorming, Bad ideas is something that always results in some pretty good brainstorming sessions. Generally, we end up laughing a lot and that's group bonding. But also, we end up with some good ideas as well.  
 
Do you feel like you can have effective discussions as a team using the existing tools and technology you just mentioned?   
I don't think anything can truly fully replicate real-life conversations. Or at least in the technology that we have currently. There are some limitations to it.  
 
So, it's like... But one of the pros of having the technology that we have right now is remote collaboration. But it does come with its limitations as well. But ultimately, I guess... It's not too bad, honestly.  
 
What do you mean by limitations? You said one thing is remote collaboration, but it has limitations. What do you mean by that?   
Obviously, when you're on a Zoom call with somebody, for example, you can't gauge their facial expressions or if they're being sarcastic, their tone of voice. You're not sure if they're just joking around or what.  
 
But in real life, that stuff translates much better. And there's also a level of spontaneity. If you and your friends finish class and you're like, who wants to go for a drink? And I'm like, yeah, okay, let's go for a drink.  
 
And we all go to the red room. So, that sort of thing does not happen after a Teams call or a Zoom call.   

So, does that mean you kind of value interpersonal relationships when you are having group work?   
Yes, I would say that's the whole point for me, to be honest.  
 
So, do you feel like you work better with teams that you are more bonded to? What makes you feel bonded to your team?   
I used to think it was shared interests, but actually, no. It's got more to do with shared values. For example, if one person on the team seems to think that it's absolutely okay to just show up to class late, for example.  
 
So, as long as you have shared values with a group of people, it doesn't matter how different the interests are. You will always feel a little... You'll find your place with them, is what I mean.  

So, how does that impact your ability to work well as a team?   
I'll have to think about that one.  
 
Shared values, yeah. Generally, if you have shared values with someone, you're less likely to have conflicts with someone. You could have shared interests, but if it doesn't ultimately equate to shared values or things that you respect, it's not going to lead anywhere.  
 
Last question, how have your teams usually been structured? In terms of roles, responsibilities, how do you work together?   
I don't mind being the leader, but a lot of times, I do get pushed into the leadership position simply because I'm the one talking the most. But generally, I think I mentioned this before also, we tend to assign work and then go do our work separately, come back, meet together and see how it all ties together. That's what's worked so far.  
 
It's not ideal, but this is generally how it is. I guess even in the teams where I've been a leader or I haven't been a leader, I really don't do too well in teams where there is a strict hierarchy where somebody is like, oh, I'm the team leader, you have to listen to me, you have to do all this, I don't like that stuff. And when I'm also in a position of leadership, I also don't, I try not to be like that.  
 
So, yeah, it's very hard to say what is the power structure or the rules, I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, there are no strong power structures in the groups that I tend to be a part of. We do have different roles in terms of, we have designers, we have researchers, we have programmers and things like that.  
 
But everybody has an equal and important role, I think.   

Okay. Cool.  
Yeah, okay.   

That's it. Thank you.
