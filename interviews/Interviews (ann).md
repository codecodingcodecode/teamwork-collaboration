## Interview 1: Jack – 20, 2nd Year, Electrical Engineering
Interviewer: Hey Jack, thanks for doing this interview. Just to kick things off, can you tell me a bit about yourself, like what you’re studying, what year you're in?  
Jack: Yeah, for sure. I'm 20, currently in my second year of Electrical Engineering.  
Interviewer: Nice. I’m guessing you’ve done your fair share of group projects by now?   
Jack: Oh yeah, pretty much every semester has at least one. There was ENGG1100 in the first year, that was a massive group design project. Then we’ve had group labs, coding projects, and even a robotics assignment recently.    
Interviewer: And how have those experiences been for you overall?    
Jack: Honestly, a mix. I’ve had teams where everything clicked, everyone contributed, we had fun, and we smashed it. But there’ve also been groups where I’ve ended up doing way more than my share. It really depends on the people you get.  
Interviewer: Yeah, fair enough. Do you remember any particular challenges that came up?  
Jack: For sure. One group didn’t really get how GitHub worked, so we kept clashing over versions and accidentally deleting stuff. Communication’s always a big one too. People say they’ll do something and then ghost for three days. You start second-guessing everything.  
Interviewer: That kind of radio silence would definitely be frustrating. Did it ever get to the point where you were just over it?  
Jack: Yep. There was one group where I basically became the unofficial project manager, not by choice. I was coordinating everyone, fixing bugs, and chasing people up. It drained me like I couldn’t focus on learning the content, I was too busy herding cats.  
Interviewer: I feel like that happens a lot more than people admit. When things are working well, though, what makes it work?  
Jack: Communication and accountability. Even if you're behind, just say so, it’s fine, we can adjust. But if you say “all good” and then don’t do your part, that wrecks it for everyone. Also, using proper tools helps, shared calendars, task lists, that sort of thing.  
Interviewer: What kind of tools do you usually use in teams?  
Jack: Mostly Discord for chat and calls. Google Docs for reports, obviously. Trello if someone sets it up. GitHub for code, though it depends if people actually know how to use it properly. Sometimes people pretend to and then you get... disasters.  
Interviewer: Been there. Do you reckon those tools are enough for effective collaboration?  
Jack: I mean... they can be. But they rely on people using them right. Like Trello’s useless if no one checks it. Discord works if people actually respond. It’s less about the tool and more about the team culture, I think.  
Interviewer: Totally. And how are roles usually decided in your teams? Like, do you divvy things up or just wing it?  
Jack: Usually, we divvy things up informally. Like “you’re better at reports, you take that, I’ll do hardware.” But sometimes no one really wants to lead, and that’s when things stall. In the better teams, someone naturally steps up to coordinate, even if it’s unofficial.  
Interviewer: That’s fair enough, thank you, Jack!

## Interview 2: Aisha – 23, Final Year, Master of Architecture
Interviewer: Thanks for making time, Aisha! Could you start by telling me a bit about yourself, what you’re studying and where you’re at in the program?  
Aisha: Sure! I'm in my final year of the Master of Architecture at UQ. I also did my undergrad here, so I've been part of the EAIT faculty for... five years now?  
Interviewer: So plenty of group work under your belt then?  
Aisha: Oh yeah. Studio projects are almost always collaborative. We usually work in pairs or teams of three to five. I think I’ve done over a dozen group assignments at this point.  
Interviewer: That’s wild. Have those mostly been smooth, or?  
Aisha: Mostly okay, though there’s always a bit of tension at some point. Architecture is such a subjective field and people get very emotionally attached to their designs. So when your ideas clash, it can feel personal even when it’s not meant to be.  
Interviewer: Yeah, I imagine that creative conflict can be tricky. Has that ever derailed a project for you?  
Aisha: Not entirely, but it’s definitely slowed things down. One time, we spent two whole meetings debating over facade aesthetics when we had a submission due in a few days. In the end, someone just had to back down. But it kind of left a bitter taste.  
Interviewer: Yeah, I can see how that would mess with the team dynamic. What else tends to make or break your group work?  
Aisha: Honestly? Presence. Like just turning up, physically or virtually. The best groups I’ve been in had people who actually showed up to meetings and put in the hours. The worst ones had at least one ghost.  
Interviewer: Happens more often than it should. When it comes to collaboration, do you feel like your voice gets heard?  
Aisha: In most teams, yes. But I’ve also been the only woman in the group, or the only one not from a particular cultural background, and sometimes that changes things. Not always in a bad way, but you notice when your ideas get sidelined. It affects how much you’re willing to speak up later on.  
Interviewer: That’s a really good point. So when teams do work well, what’s the secret sauce?  
Aisha: Open-mindedness. Mutual respect. And honestly, good structure. When we had someone take a “coordination” role, like tracking deadlines or checking in on tasks, it made everything flow better. It doesn’t even have to be formal, just someone who takes initiative.  
Interviewer: What about tools? What do you typically use in your teams?  
Aisha: We use Miro for brainstorming, which is amazing. Google Drive for sharing docs and drafts. Canva or InDesign for visual stuff. Group chats on Messenger or WhatsApp. We used Slack once, but people didn’t really engage with it.  
Interviewer: Do you think those tools support effective collaboration?  
Aisha: Partially. Miro’s great for early design stages. But chats get chaotic fast, like 100 unread messages and you miss the one important detail. I wish we had better systems for tracking decisions or action items across platforms.  
Interviewer: And how are roles usually structured?  
Aisha: It’s mostly skill-based. If someone’s great at modelling, they get the Rhino files. If someone writes well, they take on the report. But I wish there was more explicit structure early on. It would save a lot of “wait, who was doing that again?” moments.

## Interview 3: Kevin – 21, 1st Year, Computer Science
Interviewer: Alright Kevin, thanks for chatting! Can you just start by telling me what you’re studying and where you’re up to?  
Kevin: Yep! I’m 21, in my first year of Computer Science at UQ. Just finished my second semester.  
Interviewer: Awesome. So you’ve had a bit of exposure to group work by now?  
Kevin: Yeah, I had a couple of group projects, one where we built a website, and another where we made a mini game. Both were with teams of three or four.  
Interviewer: And how’d that go?  
Kevin: Pretty mixed. The web project was rough, we didn’t communicate properly and left things too late. But the game project was way better. We set up weekly calls and planned everything on a shared doc. Huge difference.  
Interviewer: What made the second one go smoother, do you think?  
Kevin: Honestly? Having one person take the lead helped. She kept us on track, reminded us of tasks, and was super organised. We didn’t really vote on it, she just kind of became the organiser and it worked.  
Interviewer: That kind of leadership sounds underrated. Were there any challenges you ran into along the way?  
Kevin: Yeah, version control was a big one. We used GitHub, but some of us were new to it. One teammate pushed an old version and it broke half the code. Also, people had different work styles, some would start early, others would cram. That caused tension.  
Interviewer: Ever find yourself feeling frustrated?  
Kevin: Yeah. Especially when someone said “I’ll get it done tonight” and didn’t, and didn’t tell anyone either. That silence is worse than being late, because you don’t know whether to jump in or wait.  
Interviewer: For sure. And on the flip side, what makes a team feel good to be in?  
Kevin: I really value honesty. Like if you’re stuck, just say so. It’s fine. Also clear roles, when it’s ambiguous, we either duplicate work or leave gaps. A shared task list helped heaps in my second group.  
Interviewer: What tools did you all use?  
Kevin: Discord for calls and chat, GitHub for code, Trello for tracking tasks. Google Docs for reports. And VS Code Live Share was handy, you can literally code at the same time and see each other’s cursors.  
Interviewer: Did you find those tools helped with collaboration?  
Kevin: When used properly, yes. But like... Trello only worked because one of us kept it updated. Otherwise, it’s just a pretty board. Discord was great for calls, though sometimes we got distracted talking about gaming instead of working.  
Interviewer: Haha, very relatable. Final question, how were roles usually assigned?  
Kevin: Usually, we split by strengths. Like “you take front-end, I’ll do logic.” But no formal titles. It worked okay as long as people spoke up early about what they couldn’t do, which saved time later.  
Interviewer: Thanks for the interview, Kevin, all the best!
